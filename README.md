# regression_models_final
This project predicts house prices using features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and more. 
It trains and optimizes two regression models: Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
Hyperparameter tuning is performed using Bayesian Optimization via Optuna for improved model performance.
